Second version of disc golf competition calendar. First one was bit scuffed...

Plan is to make easy to use website which helps to plan when to play rounds. Nobody wants to drive a hour to a course to be surprised that it is reserved for a competition.
Metrix.com has a versatile competition calendar, but I want my own that i can customize to my liking.

Possible functionalities:
  - Weather forecast
  - Link to competitions Metrix site
  - Link to courses udisc.com or frisbeegolfradat.fi sites
  - Link to Google Maps for driving instructions
  - Mark competitions or courses as favourites
  - Alert system for approaching empty days on favourite courses
  -
