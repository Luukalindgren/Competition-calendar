# Competition calendar

---------------------!WORK IN PROGRESS!---------------------

Plan is to make easy to use website which helps to plan when to play disc golf rounds. Nobody wants to drive a hour to a course to be surprised that it is reserved for a competition.
Metrix.com has a versatile competition calendar, but I want my own that i can customize to my liking.

## Possible functionalities:
  - Weather forecast
  - Link to competitions Metrix site
  - Link to courses udisc.com or frisbeegolfradat.fi sites
  - Link to Google Maps for driving instructions
  - Mark competitions or courses as favourites
  - Alert system for approaching empty days on favourite courses
  - 

## What I learned:
  - Website hosting for free (GitHub Pages and render.com)
  - MERN -stack:
    - Web development with React (+Vite)
    - Backend development with MongoDB, Express, Node.js
  - Web scraping with Python
  -
